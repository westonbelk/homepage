# The Root of All Evil... OR... Adding Insult to Injury

## Instructions

Great news! Luciafer has been spotted at an internet cafe! She's using her laptop right now! We can catch her, if we act quickly.

We need your help. Can you figure out a way to remotely connect to her machine and capture the flag?

Her username on her system is `luciafer`, and her hostname is:  
`batescafe.deadface.io`

Use the PCAP from **Monstrum ex Machina**
