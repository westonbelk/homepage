# The SUM of All FEARS

## Instructions

After hacking a victim's computer, Luciafer downloaded several files, including two binaries with identical names, but with the extensions `.exe` and `.bin` (a Windows binary and a Linux binary, respectively).

What are the MD5 hashes of the two tool programs? Submit both hashes as the flag, separated by a `|`: `flag{ExeMD5|BinMD5}`

Use the PCAP from **LYTTON LABS 01 - Monstrum ex Machina**.
