# Blood Bash 2

## Instructions

We've obtained access to a system maintained by bl0ody_mary. We believe bl0ody_mary stole a sensitive document and is storing it on her Linux machine. Search her system for any files relating to De Monne Financial.

Username: `bl0ody_mary` Password: `d34df4c3`

`bloodbash.deadface.io:22`

## Solution
In [Blood Bash](Blood%20Bash) we grepped for flag and discovered the flag for this challenge as well. (A hidden file in the documents directory.)
