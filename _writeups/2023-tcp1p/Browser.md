# Browser

## Instructions

**Author**:Â `daffainfo`

Maybe some people in this world have tried forensics on Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. What if we try to do forensics on this unknown browser?

## Solution

Looking at the `History` database, we can see that there's a Pastebin link. Unfortunately this link is prompting us for a password.

A bit of poking around the manifests in the extensions folder leads me to believe we're looking at an Opera browser.Since Opera is based on Microsoft Edge, I did a bit of research and found that autofill data is stored in the `Web Data` database. Opening this database leads us to the autofill password for the Pastebin.
