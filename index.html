Hiya, my name is Weston Belk and I'm a student at Clemson University pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration. Currently, I am vice president of the <a href="https://cucyber.net/">Clemson Cyber Security Club</a> where I prepare or give weekly presentations on cyber security-related topics as well as teach other members how to secure computer networks and information. You can find a more extensive copy of my work and leadership history <a href="/cv/">here</a>.

In my free time I enjoy expanding and maintaining my personal network infrastructure, playing video games, dancing, and watching football.
